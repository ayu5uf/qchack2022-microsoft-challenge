# Free Form Challenge - Quantum Image processing 

## Introduction
This program utilises the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (also known as [FRQI](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/image-processing-frqi-neqr.html)) in order to search for 4x4 patterns in greyscale images. A greyscale image is generated, then rotations and translations of the image matrix are processed.

## Prerequisites
* [Microsoft Azure QDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk)

## Background info
Quantum Image Processing is an fast growing field within the quantum computing space, this project explores that field by generating an 4x4 image that has been rotated and translated inside a 8x8 grid.
