# Free Form Challenge - Quantum Image processing 

## Introduction
This program utilises the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (also known as [FRQI](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/image-processing-frqi-neqr.html))  A greyscale checkerboard image is encoded, then rotations and translations of the image matrix are processed.

## Prerequisites
* [Microsoft Azure QDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk)

## Background info
Quantum Image Processing is an fast growing field within the quantum computing space, this project explores that field by encoding a simple 4x4 image that has been rotated and translated inside a 8x8 grid.
